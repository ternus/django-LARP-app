infiltration team, or an evil wizard with a group of brainwashed thralls.*
'Working under others' might be an enforcer, assassin, researcher, agent, trusted
lieutenant, or Judas.<br />
As a very general rule of thumb, high-ranking people rely on those loyal to them to get stuff done.
For example, a professor might have lots of research plots but a zero research stat, relying on her
grad students (all of whom have high research stats and plots of their own) to get research done.<br />
* Neither the Pope nor evil wizards appear in this game.
